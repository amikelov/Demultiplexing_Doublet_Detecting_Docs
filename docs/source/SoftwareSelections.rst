`Software Selection Tool <Calculator_final_version.html>`_
----------------------------------------

Use our `software selection tool <Calculator_final_version.html>`_ to automatically provide the softwares to use based on the charateristics of your data which follows the flowchart below.
It will also estimate the number of expected doublets and singlets depending on the single-cell capture method employed.


Based on our analysis of demultiplexing and doublet detecting softwares, we have generated the following decision tree to help other researchers elect the best set of softwares for their dataset.

After you have run the softwares you selected, we have provided a script that will help merge and summarize the results from the softwares together.
See :ref:`Combine Results <Combine-docs>`.
